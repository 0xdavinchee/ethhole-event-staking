  <h3 align="center">Ethhole Event Staking</h3>

  <p align="center">
    Write a program that lets people pay a small amount, RSVP for an event, and if they donâ€™t show up then everyone who did shares in the reward. A person can create an event, and check people in. If someone RSVPs but doesn't get checked in they lose their staked ETH.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/0xdavinchee/ethhole-event-staking.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

To compile: `npx hardhat compile`.

To run tests: `npx hardhat test`.

Run `npx hardhat node` to start up a local node.

Open up another terminal window and run `npx hardhat deploy --network localhost` to deploy your project to localhost.

Connect to the hardhat console at localhost with `npx hardhat console --network localhost` and create an instance of the contract and attach it to the address it was deployed to:

```
const contract = await (await ethers.getContractFactory("<CONTRACT_NAME>")).attach("<ADDRESS>");
```

This will give you access to the functions of the contract. You can get multiple accounts to interact with the contract using

```
const accounts = await hre.getUnnamedAccounts()
```
